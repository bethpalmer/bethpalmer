    	<h3>How the game was created</h3>
		<p>This game was created using object-orientated JavaScript prgramming. The game engine and graphics were provided to me and I added the functionality of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the enemy bugs travelling horizontally across the screen</li>
			<li>the ability of the character to move within the game bounds listening for events from the keyboard arrow keys</li>
			<li>the detection of collisions between the enemy bugs and the character to end the game</li>
			<li>the success of the character reaching the waters edge to win the game</li>
		</ul>
